This is a personal project and isn't intended to be used by people other than me.

--------------MacOS--------------
Creating an exec file.

1. Open terminal, go to directory of court_booking.py file.
2. Run the command 'pyinstaller court_booking.py' 
3. exec file will be in the dist file.
---------------------------------

Can also just run the court_booking.py file in the current directory of the py file instead of creating an exec file.
