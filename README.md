MacOS : Creating an exec file.

1. Open terminal, go to directory of court_booking.py file.
2. Run the command 'pyinstaller court_booking.py' 
3. exec file will be created in the dist file.

I have had problems with the exec file not working. It cannot find the config file. So if I want to create a working exec, I need to hardcode the credentials - or find a fix.

OR

Just run the program in the terminal.
